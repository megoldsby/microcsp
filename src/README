To build a single program, use make1.  To (build and) run a single program use run1.  For example, 
    ./run1 examples/ring1

In order to reproduce the timings results of the timing tests (such as ring1 or commstime), first comment out the bodies
of the enable_interrupts and disable_interrupts functions in hardware.c, making them no-ops.  Doing so takes the
extreme inefficiency of setting signal masks to enable and disable interrupts out of the equation.
