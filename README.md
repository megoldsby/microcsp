Microcsp is a process-oriented run-time executive written in C featuring CSP-style synchronous communication over point-to-point channels and alternation (including timeouts). It supports process priorities and preemptive scheduling. The Microcsp programmer writes a process’s logic as an ordinary function that runs to completion every time the process is scheduled. To make such an approach feasible requires that the programmer cast the process’s logic in normal form. A context switch requires a mere function call, with the exception of those that occur as the result of an interrupt. The system is memory-efficient, fast and has a narrow hardware interface. The current version runs over a Linux implementation of the hardware interface.
