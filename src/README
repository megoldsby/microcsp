In order to reproduce the timings results of the timing tests
(such as ring1 or commstime), first comment out the bodies
of the enable_interrupts and disable_interrupts functions
in hardware.c, making them no-ops.  Doing so takes the
extreme inefficiency of setting signal masks to enable and
disable interrupts out of the equation.
